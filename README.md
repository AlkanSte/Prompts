# Prompts

# Prompt Engineering Repository

Welcome. This is where I store prompts. Prompts that solve specific problems. Each prompt follows three principles:

1. **Universality of Models**: Versatile prompts. Work across models and scenarios.
2. **Robustness to Common Errors**: Handle and correct mistakes.
3. **Limited Token Size**: Concise. Efficient use of token limits.

## Philosophical Approach

Unhinged yet rational. This is neo-antireactionary prompt engineering. Innovation. Forward-thinking. Genius is in the details and humility.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
